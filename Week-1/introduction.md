##Welcome to the Computing Core Skills and Open Source Software part of CPU4000

In this part of the module we'll familiarise you with some of the tools used by the software industry, and develop your skills and understanding of some industry practices.

In this first session we'll be setting up a blog using Wordpress, and writing a few posts.

It may surprise you that in every job in IT you actually spend a lot more time writing in English than you ever do in a programming language - so written communication is a core skill. The best way to improve it is to practice it, and so every week in class will involve some writing. Each of these written pieces will contribute to your final assessment.

As this is the first class, you haven't had any set reading (or viewing), but note in every future class there will always be videos to watch or articles to read BEFORE coming to class.

Its important you do the reading or watching as we won't be going over the material again in class.
