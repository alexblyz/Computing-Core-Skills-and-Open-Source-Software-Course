## What roles and careers are interesting in computing?

There are hundreds of different kinds of roles and jobs in computing, or related to computing, as well as quite a few different ways to be self-employed, or engage as a volunteer.

In class we'll brainstorm as many options as we can think of.

Afterwards, pick an option that looks interesting, explore it and write up your findings as a blog post.

Remember:

* Write in full sentences
* Find good articles to link to from within your post
* Consider both the upsides and downsides
* Ask whether this is something you could imagine yourself doing
* Think about the kind of qualities that the role would require
