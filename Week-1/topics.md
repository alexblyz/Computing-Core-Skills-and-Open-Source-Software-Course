## What are the interesting topics in computing?

Computing is a really diverse subject, and touches every aspect of the way we live.

In class, we'll brainstorm ideas for interesting topics.

Afterwards, write a post about one topic that interests you.

Make sure to:

* Write using full sentences
* Find some good articles to link to from your post
* Explain why it interests you in particular
* Consider the implications - what will happen in the future?
